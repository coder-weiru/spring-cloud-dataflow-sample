Ethereum is a good buy at these levels, says Tom Lee.
Regardless of Thursday’s bounce, the recent carnage in digital currencies has tested the resolve of many in the crypto community. But one Wall Street strategist, a longtime bitcoin bull, is not only unfazed by the plunge, he’s gotten even more optimistic.

Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, in his latest take, predicts that bitcoin will hit $25,000 this year, which is four years ahead of schedule. Furthermore, his model shows it will reach $125,000 by 2022. This after bitcoin just lost half its value from its December high.

“We expect bitcoin’s major low to be $9,000, and we would be aggressive buyers around that level,” Lee said. “We view this $9,000 as the biggest buying opportunity in 2018.” At last check, bitcoin BTCUSD, +3.39%  was approaching $12,000.

Bitcoin, of course, wasn’t the only crypto getting slammed. The entire group saw hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap disappear in a matter of days. But amid that carnage, Lee sees lots of potential, particularly in three bitcoin alternatives.

He said he sees Ethereum rising to $1,900 by the end of the year, up from about $1,000 on Thursday. He also likes Ethereum Classic, which he expects to double to $60 from $30. His predicts his third pick, Neo, will jump to $225 from $148.
